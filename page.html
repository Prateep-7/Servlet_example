	<h1>TREE PLANTATION</h1><br>
	<p>
	A tree is a symbol of tolerance; it takes the rain, storms, heat and cold. It gets cut down and abused, yet it still continues to provide shelter for animals, shade for undergrowth, oxygen, fruit, and flowers for everyone/everything.

Since 2009 we have planted 3000 fruit and forest trees spread over a 6 acre area. We have spent approximately Rs. 5 Lakhs on this project. The area above Sashi House which is about 2.5 acres has grown well with trees above 15 to 20 feet height.

However, the area below Sashi House is under developed due to lack of funds and needs attention. It needs a thorough slashing, some replanting and a proper fire line. It needs care for another 3 years. Once the trees grow they take care of themselves, and the fruits sales will provide money to keep the plantation healthy.

Planting more trees is the best service you can do for the future generations.
